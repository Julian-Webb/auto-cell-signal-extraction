###### Timing the Code ######

### high_res_test_stack ###
image dimensions: 2048 x 1536
frames          : 13

With
roi_width = roi_height = 8 pixels
it takes about 300s = 5min to execute (when using Fiji for ROI signals and not calculating distance matrix)


### calcium image ###
image dimensions: 2048 x 1536
frames          : 2776

With
roi_width = roi_height = 16 pixels
it already takes ~30min for FIJI to compute ROI signals

With
roi_width = roi_height = 32 pixels
It takes about 300s = 5min to execute (when using Fiji for ROI signals and not calculating distance matrix)
