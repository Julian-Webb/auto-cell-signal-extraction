###### Timing the Code ######

### high_res_test_stack ###
image dimensions: 2048 x 1536
frames          : 13

With
roi_width = roi_height = 8 pixels
it takes about 300s = 5min to execute (when using Fiji for ROI signals and not calculating distance matrix)


### calcium image ###
image dimensions: 2048 x 1536
frames          : 2776

With
roi_width = roi_height = 16 pixels
it already takes ~30min for FIJI to compute ROI signals

With
roi_width = roi_height = 32 pixels
It takes about 300s = 5min to execute (when using Fiji for ROI signals and not calculating distance matrix)


#### Without using Fiji & without distance-adjusted similarity matrix:######
high_res_test_stack
    For 8 x 8 pixels, it takes 73s to execute

    For 4 x 4 pixels, it takes 7min to get the ROI signals.
        the clustering process gets killed (9:SIGKILL) -> probably due to excessive memory usage

calcium image
    For 16 x 16 pixels:
        get_roi_signals: 20s
        computing clusters: 65s
        total: ~100s

    For 8 x 8 pixels:
        get_roi_signals: 40s
            saving roi signals to csv takes very long -> this can be turned off
        computing clusters -> doesn't finish after >10 min
